(** Type that represents in-process server.  It receives messages with type
    ['req] and sends messages with type ['resp].
    Clients send messages with type ['req] and receive messages with type
    ['resp].
    Type parameters names don't mean that every request must have only one
    response: communication is bidirectional/duplex.  Think it's a typed
    TCP/IP.
    ['kind] is almost not used now, it's left for future api extensions to
    support other kinds of servers: servers with strict request-response
    style of work, servers that don't require connection (stateless).

type (-'req, +'resp, 'kind) server

(** Type of value used to control server: for now, it's possible to shutdown
    server and to wait for server shutdown using value of this type.
    This functionality is separated from values of type [server], since there
    may exist code that should be able to only connect to server, but not to
    shutdown it, and these privileges can be separated by hiding [server_ctl]
    value from code that shouldn't be able to control server.

(** Type that represents connection to in-process server or client.
    Values of type ['snd] are sent to connection, values of type ['rcv] are
    received.
