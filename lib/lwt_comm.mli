(** Type that represents in-process server.  It receives messages with type
    ['req] and sends messages with type ['resp].
    Clients send messages with type ['req] and receive messages with type
    ['resp].
    Type parameters names don't mean that every request must have only one
    response: communication is bidirectional/duplex.  Think it's a typed
    TCP/IP.
    ['kind] is almost not used now, it's left for future api extensions to
    support other kinds of servers: servers with strict request-response
    style of work, servers that don't require connection (stateless).
 *)
type (-'req, +'resp, 'kind) server

(** Type of value used to control server: for now, it's possible to shutdown
    server and to wait for server shutdown using value of this type.
    This functionality is separated from values of type [server], since there
    may exist code that should be able to only connect to server, but not to
    shutdown it, and these privileges can be separated by hiding [server_ctl]
    value from code that shouldn't be able to control server.
 *)
type server_ctl

(** Type that represents connection to in-process server or client.
    Values of type ['snd] are sent to connection, values of type ['rcv] are
    received.
 *)
type (-'snd, +'rcv, 'kind) conn

(** ACKs.

    Connection part (sending or receiving) can behave as
    - message queue in memory, sender puts values, receiver takes them.
      No ACKs or other flow control.
    - single memory cell that requires receiver to confirm processing of
      message.  This is needed in cases when message processing can fail due
      to real world issues, for example, when server sends/receives data from
      socket.  Here the error must be raised as soon as possible: [send] call
      must fail.  We say that such connection "uses ACKs".

    [connect]'s [?ack_req] and [?ack_resp] arguments determine whether sending
    and receiving parts of connection to server will use ACKs.

    When client/server has processed message received using [recv_no_ack]
    ([recv_no_ack_opt], [recv_no_ack_res]), [ack] function must be called
    on this connection.  For ACK-enabled connection, [ack]:
    - tells sender "the message was processed ok, now wake up and continue your
      tasks"
    - tells other senders (that are blocked waiting for their chance to send
      request to server) "now next sender can wake up and send message"

    When there is an error processing message, connection must be closed using
    [close ~exn:..] (in case of server, if error is an exception, it can be
    thrown from connection's handler thread, connection will be closed too).

    When connection is closed with exception, all waiting senders wake up with
    given exception.

(** Create new server ("outer server") that automates reconnections to server

    server.

(** Switch is a server ("outer server") that allows one to communicate with
