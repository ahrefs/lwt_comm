(** Type that represents in-process server.  It receives messages with type
    ['req] and sends messages with type ['resp].
    Clients send messages with type ['req] and receive messages with type
    ['resp].
    Type parameters names don't mean that every request must have only one
    response: communication is bidirectional/duplex.  Think it's a typed
    TCP/IP.
    ['kind] is almost not used now, it's left for future api extensions to
    support other kinds of servers: servers with strict request-response
    style of work, servers that don't require connection (stateless).

(** [duplex serverfunc] creates a server that work in duplex mode, without
    special request-response interaction patterns.
    [serverfunc] is called with connection from client passed as argument,
    when client connects to server.
    Each connection spawns an lwt thread returned by [serverfunc].
    When [serverfunc] returns [()], connection is closed automatically,
    if it was not closed before.
